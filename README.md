# Revenue Recognition System

A simple CRUD application for manipulating data of user's purchases.  
The main aim is to allow users to calculate the revenue based on different input types and factors.  
It also uses the open API of Narodowy Bank Polski to calculate values in different currencies.  

Authorization was implemented through the JWT token.
